# Vendored copy of spine-toolkit's lint. Plugins share no code; update both or neither.
# Checks a platform plugin's manifest skill against the spine-toolkit contract.
# Validates the five tables' presence, Roles content (vocabulary, named agents
# exist, fan-out rows that core can actually match, no duplicate left-hand
# sides) and Entrypoints content (a named skill exists). Topics content is NOT
# checked here — a manifest may name topic skills that don't resolve within its
# own plugin as a teaching device (spine-toolkit's reference fixture does);
# real platforms get their Topics checked by their own test suite. Entrypoints
# is checked because core calls it by name at install time, where a typo is
# indistinguishable from the legitimate '—' and surfaces only after the config
# is already written.
